# The Basics

## Data Dictionary Purpose

A Data Dictionary is a collection of names, definitions, and attributes about data elements that are being used or captured in a database, information system, or part of a research project. It describes the meanings and purposes of data elements within the context of a project, and provides guidance on interpretation, accepted meanings and representation. A Data Dictionary also provides metadata about data elements. The metadata included in a Data Dictionary can **assist in defining the scope and characteristics of data elements**, as well **the rules** for their usage and application.
